# Build a Babel Fish with Machine Learning Language Services

This repository contains necessary resources for AWS workshop. In this readme you will find detailed instructions for `Phase 3`.

## Phase 3: Convert text to audio

Use Lambda service in the AWS Console to open `PollyLambda` function. In the `Add triggers` section on the left configure trigger for this function:

1. Choose S3 as the trigger and go to the `Configure triggers` section.
1. Pick correct S3 bucket name.
1. Pick `PUT` as event type.
1. Put `.txt` as suffix.
1. Click `Add` at the bottom of the page to add trigger.
1. Click `Save` at the top of the page to confirm changes to the function.

Implement the function to use translation result and synthesize it with Amazon Polly.

> Hint: Your function should put synthesis result to an `.mp3` file in project's S3 bucket in `output` folder and use the same file naming convention as Babel Fish JavaScript component.

> Hint: You may want to look up [Amazon Polly Boto 3 Docs](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/polly.html) or inspire yourself with [Amazon Polly Synthesize Speech Example](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/SynthesizeSpeechSamplePython.html).

> Hint: Getting behind? No worries, we've got you covered! When the time is up speakers will provide the password to the `solution.zip` file with a ready solution and will show how to apply it to unblock next steps.

## Testing

That's it! :) It's time to let your Babel Fish out :) To test the full solution, open your Babel Fish web app, record yourself or upload an audio file (you can use example files from the setup phase), verify in the S3 bucket if an `mp3` file with synthesized speech is created and listen to the spoken output played automatically by the app.

> Hint: If it didn't work you may start troubleshooting by:
> 1. checking if translation result `txt` file is non-empty and contains text that makes sense,
> 1. checking Lambda function logs in CloudWatch for errors (to do that navigate to `Monitoring` tab in the AWS Console, see relevant documentation [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/monitoring-functions-logs.html)).
